many

accomplish

this

its

how
about

this

very

what
discussed
with

around

anything

how

you

suggesting
you
replace

hey
brntbeer
added
that
line
because
setup
maintained
instance
since

year

getting

starts
with
very
clear
indication
ask
team
you
need
further
assistance
chat
solutions-engineering
you
have
access
travisci.slack.com
room
having
said
would
prefer
let
people
know
that
they
can
reach
they
want
talk
about
instance
instead
taking
day
two
find
who
had
set
would
more
inclined
remove
sentence
whole
than
add
more
people
any
preference
was
play
words
with
demo
octodemo
but
with
demos
plural
guess
only
made
sense
mind
consider
changed
brntbeer
bitoiu
totally
understand
was

somewhat
isolated
not
much
isolated
than
hence
there
security
concerns
one
should
make
sure
not
mix
same
machine
containers
which
should
strictly
segregated
lightweight
big
plus
lighter
weight
process
lightweight
process
with
its
own
filesystem
lightweight
but
needling
here
lightweight
indeed
perceived
value
sales
let
vmware
make
all
money
trollface
seriously
though
that
huge
mover
here
vmware
excellent
solution
containerization
but
they
very
expensive
solution
other
cheaper
solutions
openstack
for
example
have
really
proven
themselves
real
competitors
vmware
lxc
process
containerization
lets
companies
realize
some
capabilities
vmware
without
vmware
premium
this
good
analogy
zap
find
since
all
visual
representations
for
containers
generally
show
shipping
containers
may
useful
explain
that
analogy
first
tends
break
down
because
you
could
just
easily
represent
vms
shipping
container
but
probably
useful
understand
where
terminology
comes
from
basically
for
container
images
more
like
packagecloud.io
for
containers
because
dockerhub
has
very
little
social
collaborative
capabilities
prefer
avoid
comparisons
other
software
maybe
one
can
add
link
definition
container
not
sure
whether
superficial
right
term
here
whether
should
rather
say
basic
s/older/even
longer
established
s/linux-only/unix
only
this
reads
docker
was
based
windows
vmware
has
offered
solution
for
containerization
for
some
time
vmware
has
been
around
for
while
but
has
really
only
recently
started
offering
container
solution
may
more
accurate
say
vmware
has
offered
way
manage
isolated
workloads
for
some
time
using
virtualization
contrasting
virtualization
containers
earlier
this
doc
probably
important
maintain
that
distinct
wording
here
also
just
one
man
humble
opinion
think
there
lot
more
popularity
containers
than
just
escaping
cost
vsphere
also
know
that
necessarily
consider
vmware
competition
for
containers
since
they
also
have
product
blogs.vmware.com/vsphere/2015/10/vsphere-integrated-containers-technology-walkthrough.html
that
integrates
containers
into
vsphere
thoughts
think
competition
conversation
more
about
comparing
different
container
runtimes
rkt
docker
container
management
systems
kubernetes
docker
swarm
maybe
just
flip
these
two
paragraphs
docker
based
linux
innovation
probably
better
talk
about
that
before
windows
containers
tcbyrd
yeah
gon
have
agree
with
you
this
was
very
well-researched
think
this
section
should
revamped
helaili
think
for
this
part
can
just
link
file
being
created
even
tho
finished
yet
that
way
update
one
them
have
update
both
s/chose/choose
s/chose/choose
this
document
gives
short
overview
how
install
splunk
s/overview
how

how
s/pay/spend
may
well
also
change
this
say
solutions
engineers
would
add
make
sure
you
have

otherwise
will
still
generate

will
fail
executing

openshift
requires
repository
setup
application
although
deployed
red
hat
really
deployed
kubernetes
kubernetes
deployed
red
hat
you
can
deploy
kubernetes
therefore
openshift
any
linux
distribution
that
supports
kubernetes
leefaus
could
get
you
add
some
words
these
sections
add
anything
else
you
feel
relevant
doc
well
think
you
have
pretty
good
handle
advanced
interactions
progress
integrations
that
worth
sharing
leefaus
make
sense
like
give
comparison
but
this
close
since
most
know
about
vms
least
tying
openshift
into
that
world
thought
would
easy
anchor
comparison
point

pholleran
fixed
your

wink
openshift
cartridges
actually
intiliazed
actually
you
can
just
point
just
thanks
pholleran
true
webdog
looks
like
you
just
ran
over
helaili
brntbeer
updates
wink
webhooks
perhaps
webhooks
instead
you
just
need
reverse
engineer
configuration
from
their
built-in
integration
just
basically
this
means
extracting
url
authentication
settings
from
kudu
services
that
get
setup
when
you
enable
local
repository
azure
basically
this
repository
synchronized
with
repo
not
sure
what
point
this
repository
synchronized
with
repo
you
know
how
handles
history
rewrite
end
via
rebase
way
understand
temporary
storage
location
azure
uses
stage
last
commit
then
takes
those
files
copies
them
wwwroot
directory
iis
server
builds
csproj
first
then
copies
them
over
server
not
sure
what
point
this
repository
think
understand
after
reading
one
links
bottom
works
like
heroku
repository
for
push
repository
trigger
deployment
tcbyrd
thanks
was
going
say
seemed
work
lot
like
heroku
but
have
dug
enough
into
either
them
enough
make
that
claim
but
yes
you
could
something
like
push
azure
master
trigger
deployment
same
way
this
process
just
telling
azure
pull
from
this
one
favorite
parts
fatcomma
thanks
for
adding
this
our
update
could
you
add
one
more
sentence
about
how
was
received
how
fit
into
our
strategy
around
working
with
nextdoor
folks
know
how
was
relevant
little
late
here
but
jbjonesjr
why
would
just
buy
cname
for
this
amazon
instance
anyways
reason
not
imo
jenkins.octodemo.com
add
elastic
thoughts
osowskit
adding
cname
sounds
like
great
idea
this
was
something
that
pholleran
set
should
either
agree
this
shared
instance
manage
upgrades
designate
another
blessed
jenkins
instance
with
this
becoming
shared
instance
initially
set
have
windows
machine
use
but
cool
with
being
more
looks
like
many
people
have
other
stuff
there
now
that
said
wonder
should
continue
promote
cloudbees-first
approach
like
having
both
advantage
here
for
lazy
that
our
cloudbees
instance
linux
while
this
windows
have
set
build
slaves
order
test
slack
locally
port
8080
does
not
have
used
already
which
was
case
environment
you
can
change
port
though
setting
port
environmental
variable
export
port=9999
have
add
them
local
shell
into
any
file
jonico
when
you
add
dependencies
think
when
you
start
hubot
will
get
libraries
otherwise
you
can
npm
install
hubot-deploy
save
jonico
environment
variables
you
can
add
using
export
shell
later
you
can
add
them
heroku
environment
excellent
feedback
think
should
keep
question
support
per-branch
permissions
still
get
this
question
some
notes
expectations
need
change
reviewable
does
show
under
category
did
realize
that
some
integrations
were
supported
not
sure
how
handle
this
solutions
candidates
gist
gone
back
forth
using

this
perhaps
should
call
pre-interview
questionnaire
something
pullapprove
moving
off
gist
seemed
more
like
accident
than
anything
else
though
get
where
you
coming
from
leaning
toward
leaving
unless
anyone
else
feels
passionate
about
candidates
change
definitely
artifact
different
time
integrations
mentioned
examples
not
individually
required
included
requirement
mention
specific
integration
that
performs
functions
similar
mentioned
examples
furthermore
should
flexible
accepting
integrations
that
work
for
dotcom
this
case
not
being
specific
about
which
flavor
being
reviewed
here
expect
someone
new
technical
mindset
immediately
grasp
intricacies
integrations
directory
small
nitpick
accept
ignore
this
suggestion
but
drop
here
because
reads
great
without
keeping
you
also
need
either
make
developers
singular
possessive
plural
possessive
happiness
developing
developer
most
important
skill
this
session
will
share
some
development
best
practices
focusing
collaboration
continuous
delivery
continuous
improvement
not
sure
needed
here
but
would
add
before
word
focusing
maybe
comma
after
continuous
delivery
will
discuss
how
code
quality
improves
when
you
share
your
work
with
larger
audience
public
open
code
reviews
will
explore
benefits
rigorous
testing
automated
deployments
for
smooth
readability
especially
because
this
second
sentence
short
bas
what
you
think
about
making
combining
these
two
sentences
first
will
discuss
how
code
quality
improves
when
you
share
your
work
with
larger
audience
having
public
open
code
reviews
also
explore
benefits
rigorous
testing
automated
deployments
being
involved
these
code
reviews
will
discuss
ways
bring
your
tools
into
your
chat
interface
that
you
can
better
informed
events
happening
across
teams
like
code
changes
build
statuses
deployments
would
drop
discuss
here
just
say
next
will
look
ways
bring
using
transition
word
like
next
makes
seem
like
logical
next
step
talk
about
for
talk
more
like
story
which
think
brings
cohesiveness
audience
also
possible
for
this
sentence
you
can
think
way
hook
audience
why
good
for
more
people
informed
that
great
that
some
feedback
that
got
from
talk
satellite
that
wish
had

back
penguin
used
imgur
for
mugshot
oic
was
understanding
that
profile
pics
add
here
for
people
being
able
identify
you
more
easily
they
interact
with
you
see
you
around
prs
other
threads
guess
makes
now
confused
when
see
penguin
replying
instead
image
here
switched
original
avatar
mugshot
did
want
mugshot
public
avatar
but
guess
need
drop
penguin
for
good
mean
thing
that
you
more
comfortable
with
but
just
say
set
your
profile
picture
penguin
keep
this
picture
your
profile
picture
guess
there
but
customer
facing
team
piece
consider
but
then
again
have
fun
with
job
hotdog
kfc
yield
better
results
what
kind
better
results
what
outcome
heart
very
poorly
written
behalf
want
mention
that
professional
services
can
take
care
implementations
migrations
just
very
poorly
written
would
personally
change
will
most
likely
want
learn
more
about
what
you
how
they
can
get
involved
will
most
likely
want
involved
order
make
sentence
shorter
more
point
but
this
flavour
comment
feel
like
you
need
change
smile
new
users
running
repetition
from
first
sentence
would
you
consider
speed
let
them
know
what
they
sign
let
them
know
where
they
can
sign
think
obstacle
more
about
provisioning
then
authentication
thus
replacing
sign
with
sign
would
suggest
that
you
think
will
valuable
guess
implicit
would
make
flow
first
link
followed
issues
then
markdown
not
fussed
about
last
two
but
reckon
flow
should
top
because
wink
would
try
give
more
relevance
this
section
maybe
higher
since
first
obstacle
use
any
ideas
again
this
just
opinion
but
think
this
chapter
detailed
for
rest
context
e-mail
also
think
two
steps
needed
get
your
team
set-up
stretch
step
number
also
implies
that

already
has

you
probably
want
replace

say

then
list
mellybess
just
small
nit-pick
but
this
should
change
some
key

small

next
this
explain
this
simple
workflow
start
out
with
that
explains
basics
similarly
guides
with
issues
may
want
just
say
issues
late
weight
conversations
that
people
can
use
talk
about
features
bugs
around
code
think
this
might
into
fine

detail
how
split
into

reconvened
condense
split
into
groups
with
mix
ses
from
different

professional
backgrounds

thank
you
gpadak
heart
groups
had
plenty
time
brainstorm
capture
ideas
writing
hash
out
approaches
different
parts
sales

share
personal
experiences
each
group
also
chose
specific
customer
account
use
test
case
for
their
ideas
brought
our
ideas
back
whole
team
davideg
did
excellent
job
facilitating
larger
discussions
came
out
with
lot
great
ideas
captured
writing
only
slightly
shorter
but
maybe
work
saving
sentence
for
super
important
stuff
thanks
for
feedback
mellybess
want
emphasize
some
details
session
because
think
worked
others
can
repeat
thinking
terms
team
post
but
agree
with
you
that
probably
got
bit
carried
away
take
stab
condensing
along
lines
your
suggestion

only
reason
spelled

that
shared
some
these

with

that

think
more
clear
talk
about

rather
than
using

not

this
might
something
need

also

maybe
its

this

will
start
with
overview
concepts
behind
continuous

continuous

two
cornerstones
good
software
development
this
class
technically
starting
out
introduction
stoe
bitoiu
wonder
title
could
spiced
bit
getting
started
with
implementing
pipeline
something
like
that
bitoiu
might
joining
devops
summit
london
june
july
2016
only
for
now
maybe
mwiesen
has
time
his
calendar
join
buddy
fixed
brntbeer
bitoiu
what
about
implementing
pipeline
with
stoe
yeah
that
could
work
think
description
just
has
mention
that
doing
intro
piece
well
think
better
question
what
line
for
technical
question
can
answer
ourselves
what
pass
off
kind
discussed
this
may
relevant
this
via
cli
touch
all
gits
chat

sounds
confusing
what
about
chat
application
giving
few
examples
what
mean
slack
campfire
hipchat
would
remove
beginning
last

love
idea
last
sentence
seems
like
you
accidentally
word
how
can
refactoring
our
code
with
some

can
make
for

more

teams
either
how

gotcha
chat
applications
e.g
slack

sounds
about

what
about
just
company

either
how

tcbyrd
great
catch
should
how
refactoring
our
code
with
some

jonico
would
you
make
two
sentences
have
you
been
stressing
out
about
your
application
running
production
you
wonder
what
status
those
builds
that
started
minutes
ago
would
keep
last
sentence
just
remove
beginning
company
chat
client
sounds
good
would
add
last
sentence
saying
that
talk
inspired
how
working
internally
this
will
stir
interests
like
lastly
see
how
work
like
can
bring
commands
events
into
chat
client
find
right
people
how
refactoring
our
code
with
some
science
can
make
for
happier
more
efficient
development
teams
jonico
could
even
add
this
above
have
you
had
any
trouble
connecting
dots
about
why
feature
was
developed
first
place
you
wish
you
had
better
way
refactor
your
code
struggle
with
these
questions
because
how
develop
software
this
talk
inspired
that
process
s/thw/the
using
secondary
client
letsencrypt.sh
official
let
encrypt
client
think
this
should
just
nginx
haproxy
somewhere
here
you
should
note
that
there
one
validation
per
subdomain
for
with
subdomain
isolation
this
could
take
while
true
since
web
traffic
only
goes
through
nginx
makes
sense
extra
white
space
beginning
think
this
reads
better
bold
sentence
that
table
makes
wonder
table
there
something
come
later
smile
before
going
into
steps
jbjonesjr
would
enjoy
knowing
exactly
what
will
achieve
when
done
have
finished
whole
doc
yet
but
imagine
minimum
ssl
but
maybe
you
also
steps
get
configure
ssl
for
subdomains
far
says
configuration
feels
bit
light
into
what
following

will
for
blush
would
make
this
this

listed

far

feels
bit

for

for
you
think
this
reads

that

makes
wonder

there
something
come
later
hear
that
however
like
use

call
out
notes/caveats
draw
extra
attention
bold

can
tend
get

when

defer

maybe
say
something

becoming

because
local

now
has

without

several

over

share

remove
this
entirely
how
you
collaborate
when
most
people
your

remote
how
you
ensure
code
quality
how
you
know
when
deploy
changes
how
you
know
what
people
working
what
recently
deployed
love
these
questions
would
just
use
different
hook
before
them
similar
what
you
had
before
though
like
many
other
companies
talked
seen
some
good
patterns
for
success
that
have
helped
teams
within
companies
grow
into
most
successful
units
they
could
because
they
have
looked
beyond
their
own
neighbors
for
hiring
however
there
different
challenges
you
face
when
you
start
building
more
distributed
software
company
then
ask
those
questions
will
also
talk
about
some
organizational
aspects
like
how
how
you
retain
your
organizational
culture
ensure
people
feel
part
team
what
about
will
answer
these
questions
also
answer
some
organization
aspects
like
how
retain
company
culture
make
everyone
feel
more
connected
part
team
regardless
where
they
lastly
will
talk
about
some
steps
successfully
introduce
distributed
teams
within
your
organization
finish
strong
with
end
this
talk
will
have
shared
some
first
steps
take
successfully
introduce
more
distributed
teams
within
your
organization
learn
how
support
works
person
misses
verb
e.g
goes

you
your

should
through
triage
assign

you
using
zendesk
macros
brainstorm
potential
reply
you
new

most
pairing
will
hands-off
even
though
that
probably
true
love
encourage
people
switch
positions
driver/observer
when
pairing
obviously
not
when
observing
urgent
ticket
but
whenever
something
time
critical
there
reason
not
switch
smile
people
actually
use
vagrant
this
great
what
about
one

powerpoint/excel/word
use

what
about

shikhathakkar
add
that
optional

powerpoint/excel/word
need
play

gets
along
with
current
flow
obtaining

use

find

have
around
well
davideg
suggested
making
optional

which
sounds
like
reasonable
option
might
good
drop

here
canned

provide
series
responses
for
various
facets
this
entirely
accurate
canned
replies
cover
every
imaginable
topic
that
gets
asked
customers
many
these
topics
already
included
canned
replies
also
have
canned

halp
this
list
missing
seems
like
this
could
removed
may
want
use
slack
notation
for
this
sales-engineering
fatcomma
this
checklist
covers
both
inside
teams
might
want
include
some
sort
role
solutions
engineer
join

sort
flow
doc
furthermore
they
can
use
jobs
run
tests
some
your
earlier
suggestions
for
instance
every
should
have
job
that
checks
commit
list
for
files
that
binary
certain
extensions
they
can
also
test
commits
for
message
structure
there
format
they
think
appropriate
standardize
avoid
words
like
small
might
think
small
but
sure
how
bad
could
for
given
developer
apple
lfs
will
probably
slower
than
plain
when
what
optionally
why
why
probably
given
that
will
slower
then
should
say
not
all
ignore
above
comment
when
what
there
information
what
commands
slower
since
hit
refresh
were
apple
would
read
this
suddenly
wonder
what
file
size
limits
for
lfs
you
might
consider
omitting
same
thoughts
what
happens
they
exceed
those
suggested
numbers
with
sending
this
one
communication
then
this
section
redundant
one
above
size
recommendations
unless
there
something
about
specific
legacy
vcs
that
needs
highlighted
like
subversion
repos
always
much
larger
than
repos
here
what
you
look
for
then
would
just
refer
earlier
section
remove
this
section
altogether
from
directory
you
want
check
run
following
command
find
files
over
10m
size
btw
they
probably
want
find
these
files
much
larger
context
then
just
one
directory
maybe
suggest
running
from
root
directory
searching
recursively
great
thought
adding
bullet
that
effect
agreed
remove
this
100mb
file
not
fairly
small
reasonable
limit
for
text
file
for
which
optimized
believe
this
good
rule
for
generated
code
well
lfs
here
following
with
some
performance
baselines
help
them
draw
conclusions
around
what
goes
wrong
when
repo
sizes
get
big
add
link
configuring
push
limit
useful
knowledge
for
other
customers
however
apple
has
already
seen
this
issue
fixed
use
submodules
subtrees
compose
repositories
into
functional
groups
some
in-app
dependency
management
that
speaks
til
added
your
comment
for
context
command
find
recursive
default
tho
smile
would
worthwhile
add
point
that
consider
discussion
around
source
code
almost
valuable
source
itself
from
sdlc
perspective
deleting
this
content
could
lead
degradation
process
agreed
thanks
for
mentioning
that
that
extremely
valuable
point
out
think
that
point
hard
stop
that
they
have
remove
collaboration
data
they
should
also
consider
only
removing
collaboration
when
they
ready
delete/remove
code
associated
with
what
you
think
hesitate
suggest
deleting
data
any
point
rather
let
customers
make
that
determination
delete
content
seems
like
reasonable
retention
policy
but
ianal
agreed
but
point
that
john
deere
made
regard
this
objection
that
they
need
cover
their
butts
legally
case
developer
was
leave
comment
somewhere
along
lines
like
hey
this
line
code
for
this
tractor
causes
tractor
spin
around
death-circle
making
jelly
operator
mere
seconds
that
actually
happened
that
code
actually
made
out
production
setting
morally
agree
with
you
100
delete
content
great
but
not
ones
having
cover
ourselves
grimacing
los/lost
could
this
rephrased
match
style
other
objections
think
rephrasing
this
may
also
make
objection
clearer
because
how
tied
our
collaboration
tied
code
what
does
this
mean
smile_cat
davideg
does
think
mean
that
all
ise
should
participant
thread
every
time
label
applied
often
see
threads
where
one
person
writes
drafts
one
person
reviews
this
pattern
that
you
want
move
away
from
sparkling_heart
issue
requesting
assistance
understanding
something
related
account
will
these
issues
have
specific
label/something
searchable
food
for
thought
this
sounds
simple
but
could
difficult
since
customer-feedback
requests
happen
calls
threads
trying
think
about
how
would
actually
this
was
responsibility
area
would
have
keep
all
call
issues
their
associated
halp
threads
which
often
not
have
need
have
label
all
label
halp
threads
question
search
text
for
customer
feedback
found
something
relevant
search
customer-feedback
repo
make
sure
was
logged
missing
much
simpler
way
doing
this
would
have
introduce
more
process
our
workflow
make
this
possible
was
talking
erinstanwood
jennlachman
about
idea
account
issue
sales
repo
that
would
labeled
specific
way
thought
this
could
place
where
initial
discovery
information
for
outbound
accounts
recorded
rough
fashion
e.g
notes
from
online
research
initial
calls
that
mention
team
consultative
help
could
take
place
here
still
need
think
through
not
overcomplicating
sales
team
process
across
yesware
salesforce
halp
stuck_out_tongue_closed_eyes
all
this
said
like
idea
smile_cat
nope
sorry
that
not
intention
but
can
see
how
reads
that
way
meant
more
general
way
how
about
all
members
team
should
contribute
general
effort
reviewing
others
work
but
not
necessary
for
everyone
participate
given
thread
wordy
think
can
start
off
crowd-sourcing
this
across
team
prp
really
just
there
remind
folks
when
they
see
happen
halp
threads
like
what
occasionally
for
threads
that
notice
this
think
need
have
bullet-proof
process
for
this
first
but
appreciate
your
thought
experiment
figuring
out
what
that
would
entail
definitely
open
considering
more
process
feel
priority
would
add
something
explicit
about
tracking
these
maybe
keeping
running
list
weekly
issue
that
links
shipable
draft
for
each
canned
reply
candidate
maybe
similar
table
that
vitor
uses
for
canned
reply
curation
runs
with
columns
for
topic
link
assignee
associated
does
have
fleshed
out
this
document
now
just
thought
for
keeping
track
these
fermentedbeats
you
like
crown
canned
replies
how
you
keep
track
responses
can
s/respond
by/no
later
than
think
what
this
saying
someone
says
got
one
hour
later
first
draft
out
early
a.m
bang
out
drafts
but
them
since
just
smile
would
better
actively
draft
first
then
write
draft
all
members
team
should
contribute
general
effort
reviewing
others
work
but
not
necessary
for
everyone
participate
given
thread
think
this
contrast
point
above
hours
label-to-ship
hours
label-to-thoughts
from
se_halp-review
during
business
hours
time
between
when
label
applied
when
have
shippable
response
should
average
more
than
hours
think
part
prp
role
would
doing
daily
halp
check
for
words
like
product
team
feedback
make
sure
everything
relevant
makes
across
customer-feedback
repos
smiley
bulb
find
often
answering
salesperson
question
slack
time
two
per
week
might
good
put
expectations
around
this
e.g
rep
pings
slack
what
sla
explicitly
steer
them
away
from
slack
proper
channels
oooh
like
this
idea
having
running
list
what
canned
replies
being
worked
need
crafted
just
have
running
list
daily
todo
tracker
would
better
for
team
have
visibility
smiley
fermentedbeats
think
that
good
habit
get
into
hurt
over-communicate
one-line
comment
that
you
taking
stab
draft
this
ensures
sales
rep
knows
someone
has
eyes
thread
other
ses
know
not
work
yet
that
said
obvious
you
only
one
active
you
rather
just
knock
out
draft
think
that
fine
until
team
gets
larger
fermentedbeats
sorry
this
confusing
mention
little
later
diff-42222c5f582dfdaeba147a7bff969bf9r55

questions
you
answering

related
halp
threads
those
threads
have
label
applied
them
really
slack
should
used
escalate
things
ask
general
questions
team
curious
understand
more
about
how
slack
being
used
your
idea
include
something
about
that
this
document
makes
sense
people
avoiding
proper
channels
using
slack
questions
you
answering
slack
related
halp
threads
sometimes
here
slack
examples
from
this
week
call
thread
today
rep
asked
what
say
customer
they
had
just
spoken
phone
thread
had
not
yet
been
created
customer
svn
wanted
know
how
break
their
repos
project
something
else
pinged
her
back
with
spiel
slack
file
repo
size
limits
pkg
managers
earlier
this
week
rep
pinged
room
asked
issue
templates
were
available
ghe
this
seems
like
general
question
but
did
see
this
later
fly
thread
customer
hindsight
perhaps
this
just
problem
besides
slack
reps
drop
ask
how
things
work
what
things
etc
this
week
say
this
happened
half
dozen
times
usually
just
help
them
spot
but
realize
none
this
formally
tracked
anywhere
which
seems
counterintuitive
our
tracking
efforts
seems
like
for
slack
meat_on_bone
space
drive-bys
we/i
should
ask
there
thread
leave
notes
thread
for
tracking
purposes
even
address
spot
does
that
get
where
should
probably
worth
having
explicit
bullet
for
you
should
politely
prompt
labeller
remove
solutions-engineering
label
from
threads
that
longer
need
new
feedback
think
should
extend
this
from
hours
following
business
day
follow-up
recent
big
fish
games
call
could
not
make
hours
ignoring
weekend
days
due
competing
priorities
full
queue
within
hours
this
seems
overly
ambitious
especially
call
happens
friday
regular
friday
wrap-up
stuff
ise
sync
monday
think
end
following
business
day
more
realistic
for
most
cases
but
there
will
exceptions
for
certain
calls
that
get
deep
into
topics
that
have
lot
research
should
this
include
requests
for
review
from
well
mellybess
agreed
think
end
next
business
day
better
target
fermentedbeats
like
that
approach
think
good
practice
get
anything
from
meat_on_bone
space
conversation
down
writing
possible
while
things
still
fresh
everyones
minds
should
there
should
something
this
section
specifically
about
prp
coordinating
office
hours
seems
like
important
aspect
enablement
for
our
team
this
would
take
off
davideg
plate
what
say
might
helpful
add
bullets
for
bumping
old
threads
making
sure
issues
get
closed
checking
make
sure
dates
correct
e.g
seen
wed
3/15
date
not
clear
which
part
correct
smile
did
talk
about
doing
this
for
outbound
calls
alternative
actually
being
call
imagining
things
stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye
fatcomma
agreed
this
probably
something
entire
team
should
not
just
prp
great
question
think
you
right
but
curious
these
guidelines
now
seem
aggressive
for
every
ise
team
mention
cool
this
seems
like
reasonable
change
great
points
thanks
fatcomma
yep
that
exactly
right
not
every
call
will
require
but
should
make
ourselves
available
for
short
synchronous
windows
help
rep
prep
for
call
ask
there
thread
leave
notes
thread
for
tracking
purposes
even
address
spot
100
think
good
practice
get
anything
from
meat_on_bone
space
conversation
down
writing
possible
while
things
still
fresh
everyones
minds
100
maybe
keeping
running
list
weekly
issue
that
links
shipable
draft
for
each
canned
reply
candidate
maybe
similar
table
that
vitor
uses
for
canned

curation
runs
with

for

link
assignee
associated
heart
brainstarr
think
that
great
idea
was
could
useful
create
small
document
along
with
this
area
responsibility
with
some
basic
guidelines
for
giving
effective
feedback
this
would
probably
useful
for
wider
team
well

s/store/stores

addition
addition
customer
anything
for
this
path
they
could
know
guess
this
said
other
other
words
sentence
before
after
wink
because
not
configurable
also
they
even
attach
another
storage
for
this
path
you
can
see
next
section
here
you
prefer
this
path
not
configurable
customer
can
not
redirect
lfs
another
storage
see
issue
clustering
does
change
this
somewhat
because
given
lfs
file
can
found
some
number
alambic
nodes
but
not
necessarily
every
alambic
node
cluster
which
depending
specific
configuration
setup
you
prefer
clustering
does
not
change
this
behaviour
given
lfs
file
can
found
any
number
alambic
nodes
but
not
necessary
every
one
cluster
can
attach
another
storage
for
lfs
separate
from
other
repo/database/etc
data
think
answer
for
both
ha-pair
clustering
ikeike443
think
this
because
when
customers
asking
attach
storage
believe
they
mean
stuff
like
additional
attached
storage
etc
adding
data
note
not
specific
for
lfs
generic
for
whole
data
however
you
can
configure
destination
lfs
server
your
local
gitattributes
for
each
repository
you
have
locally
think
answer
for
both
ha-pair
clustering
ikeike443
yeah
understood
from
that
sales
adding
data
note
not
specific
for
lfs
generic
for
whole
data
think
depends
situation
mean
depends
product
they
working
gaming
industry
data
lfs
can
very
different
terms
size
value
anyway
answer
though
however
you
can
configure
destination
lfs
server
your
local
gitattributes
for
each
repository
you
have
locally
yeah
but
worrying
what
will
happen
giattributes
points
3rd
party
lfs
server
ghe
config
set
lfs
maybe
large
files
will
duplicate
going
3rd
party
server
going
alambic
server
inside
ghe
this
path
not
configurable
customer
can
not
redirect
lfs
another
storage
ikeike443
this
true
for
server
but
lfs
client
can
configured
point
separate
lfs
servers
for
different
remotes
modifying
gitconfig
file
see
for
more
details
yeah
but
worrying
what
will
happen
giattributes
points
3rd
party
lfs
server
ghe
config
set
lfs
maybe
large
files
will
duplicate
going
3rd
party
server
going
alambic
server
inside
ghe
this
happen
ikeike443
since
client
only
using
one
destination
files
would
get
duplicated
unless
you
had
different
configurations
different
clones
same
repository
was
just
stating
this
option
because
some
customers
have
asked
how
this
before
think
depends
situation
mean
depends
product
they
working
gaming
industry
data
lfs
can
very
different
terms
size
value
hey
ikeike443
talking
about
different
things
here
talking
about
storage
setup
only
not
what
data
going
added
any
stores
guess
reached
same
conclusion
sales
bitoiu
this
happen
ikeike443
since
client
only
using
one
destination
cool
thanks
was
wondering
setting
lfs
ghe
could
anything
for
destination
lfs
maybe
should
investigate
what
that
setting
actually
talking
about
different
things
here
talking
about
storage
setup
only
not
what
data
going
added
any
stores
thought
you
were
talking
about
intention
customer
when
they
asking
attach
storage
thought
your
opinion
intention
always
for
generic
purpose
but
opinion
that
depends
situation
but
either
way
answer
here
think
not
big
deal
for
now
did
misunderstand
something
sorry
about
that
that
case
bow
bitoiu
according
our
convo
should
remove
this
todo
right
thanks
davideg
forgot
that
sweat
right
place
mention
another
option
that
not
recommended
but
that
you
can
keep
mind
section
btw
according
this
the-server
probably
should
use
lfsconfig
instead
right
latest
version
1.1.1
now
smile
note
lfs
used
gitconfig
instead
lfsconfig
until
lfs
v1.1
lfs
will
continue
read
gitconfig
lfsconfig
does
not
exist
until
lfs
v2.0
just
should
mention
both
yep
s/or
stuffs
like
that/and
other
stats
ikeike443
good
call
did
know
about
lfsconfig
think
you
can
just
mention
one
lfsconfig
right
place
mention
another
option
that
not
recommended
but
that
you
can
keep
mind
section
not
sure
why
would
recommend
this
someone
truly
wants
store
large
files
different
lfs
server
maybe
add
other
considerations
section
artifactory
docs
www.jfrog.com/confluence/display/rtf/git+lfs+repositories
explain
how
set
that
product
lfs
server
davideg
maybe
add
other

section
felt
should
change
section
title
from
another

that
not
recommended
but
that
you
can
keep

other

there

would

you

people
who
modern

people
who

something

helping

achieve
these
very
things
you
say
you
going
focus
your

then
talk
about

besides

bit
confusing
guessing
this

maybe
something

this
making

you

critical

you

this

look
how
your

can
bring
many
our

devops
tools
philosophies
life
for
everyone
benefit
what
other

besides

can
plug
our

get

what

this

really
about

should
summary
your

section
because
not
clear
what
this
talk
about

chatops

imho
rather
listen
session
devops
tooling
implementation
talking
about
using

less
interesting
especially
for
attendees
working
for
companies
where
chat
often
banned
however
you
use
cool
term
like
chatops
re-engaged
talk
about
chat
use
chatops
term
consistently
throughout
talk
about
other
devops

about
devops
general
reduce

reduce

can
you

suggest
folks
ping
instead
mentioning

this

your
change
but
just
noticed
stuck_out_tongue
always
read
release
notes
whenever
new
version
released
you
able
answer
customer
questions
about
upgrades
generally
avoid
providing
naked
links
s/customer-issues/customer-feedback
would
say
customer
question
think
get
what
you
saying
here
but
face
this
sentence
seems
contradictory
how
about
even
you
can
not
meet
customer
need
focus
what
value
can
provide
them
also
find

like
this
should
probably
target
same
location
coincides
with
some
our
collaboration
objectives
yes
missing
activity
measurements
like
how
many
demos
did
customer
take
until
close/lost
how
many
meetings
this
might
ignorance
but
also
need
close
lost
reports
that
visible
know
where
they
get
stored
but
would
helpful
could
track
losing
opportunity
because
lack
feature
competition
this
goes
also
figuring
out
how
long
specific
closure
takes
e.g
have
have
calls
with
potential
customer
explain
how
required
status
protected
branches
can
used
because
have
good
publicly
available
explanation
that
just
lengthens
sales
cycle
also
helps
can
use
this
data
drive
priorities
anecdotal
evidence
how
does
one
get
okta
account
does
this
happen
first
week
from
general
onboarding
think
can
remove
link
chat
going
forward
sadly
you
may
also
want
say
sign
with
okta
but
care
either
way
broken
link
for
info
about
hubot
say
either
remove
this
just
link
think
there
something
funky

noredirect
here
jasonmassey
did
you
mean
say
access
ghe.io
through
okta
also
mentions
join

instead
sales
team
also

not
sales
wink
maybe
changing
whole

read
request
join

solutions
teams
think
should
add
some

items
these
pieces
what
about

need
merit
checkbox
read
them
familiar
with
them
poultry_leg
for
thought
been
vocal
stickler
past
about
posting
team
new
hire
week
making
sure
information
filled
out
think
you
could
double
down
some
that
effort
here
for
least
our
team
saying
ensure
team
filled
out
with
first
last
name
displayed
bio
mentioning
what
team
you
what
you
here
maybe
some
helpful
long
term
fact
that
you
did
mention
your
first
post
but
you
feel
this
needed
dont
add
you
should
also
link
web
notifications
inside
itself
here
take
leave
but
think
this
header
should
way
you
have
now
makes
think
visit
because
that
our
standard
way
denoting
repository
all
repositories
developer
docs
mention
repo
name
has
include
owner
not
sure
here
but
know
that
sales
sales-operations
required
davideg
any
thoughts
here
slight
nuance
but
could
you
change
this
say
chat
tell
hubot
who
you
you
get
pings
your
phone
you
will
have
already
installed
you
should
have
already
installed
what
email
address
this
one
never
set
default
inbox
sales
know
you
didnt
add
this
but
that
should
definitely
removed
furthermore
inside
team
wouldnt
pick
any
these
could
you
make
these
line
below
links
actual
inboxes
for
ease
clicking
muscle
same
title
above
sorry
pensive
these
asterisks
misplaced
might
worth
linking
our
guiding
principles
guide
somewhere
this
section
also
s/sales/sales
stuck_out_tongue
sorry
spoke
soon
see
you
link
later
blush
would
definitely
move
sales-operations
nice
watch
but
probably
keep
sales
would
also
add
field-services
must
watch
trollface
change
remaining
slash
period
yes
every
new
hire
should
have
okta
account
set
during
onboarding
week
they
have
seek
out
good
call
adding
sign
with
okta
rip
skull
chat
agreed
adding
link
for
hubot
with
correct
url
stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye
yes
yes
again
adding
your
changes
hmmmm
agree
that
may
want
make
these
more
explicit
actions
e.g
sign
for
explore
read
however
think
need
decide
what
makes
most
sense
for
each
tool
some
not
obvious
keep
this
thought
for
subsequent
iterations
list
onboarding
class
put
quite
bit
emphasis
this
but
make
note
here
make
sure
this
information
filled
out
good
call
adding
that
thanks
guys
change
this
add

recommendations
always
looking
for
ways
improve
how
our
customers
experience
always
looking
for
ways
improve
customer
experience
with
that
mind
would
ask
you
spare
few
minutes
your
time
letting
know
which
following
best
practices
you
currently
following
that
end
could
you
please
let
know
which
following
best
practices
you
implemented
constraints
think
redundant
might
helpful
ask
how
they
know
they
currently
provisioned
properly
just
looking
hardware
recommendations
going
enough
they
have
look
monitoring
dashboard
how
often
you
upgrade
good
indication
whether
they
spending
time
making
sure
they
get
updates
etc
many
places
run
latest
because
they
have
established
upgrade
cycle
that
may
take
months
some
these
questions
going
trigger
questions
for
which
great
but
need
have
answers
ready
e.g
this
question
might
trigger
response
how
can
tell
bitoiu
though
this
canned
reply
does
this
make
sense
maybe
live
that
document
that
way
did
that
could
change
this
link
that
section
azizshamim
much
prefer
your
suggestions
thanks
azizshamim
how
often
you
upgrade
will
add
part
current
question
saves
asking
why
like
you
mentioned
though
this
canned
reply
does
this
make
sense
maybe
live
that
document
brntbeer
considered
canned
replies
doc
first
but
then
changed
mind
changes
canned
e-mail
dependent
changes
foundation
checklist
although
have
space
for
canned
materials
guess
they
live
same
document
there
higher
likelihood
that
they
get
updated
same
time
part
same
can
always
leave
internal
note
linking
back
from
canned
replies
this
document
mind
much
where
ends
you
feel
strongly
about
happy
change
yellow_heart
azizshamim
have
agree
considering
goal
first
e-mail
would
temped
take
out
but
negative
reply
this
one
would
cater
visit
call
itself
think
should
open
exception
for
this
one
get
some
logs
get
real

influence
prs
bitoiu
your

diagnostic
file
diagnostic
diagnostic
lower
case
let
you
know
which
sections
can
used
answer
some
questions
next
action
here
unclear
does
customer
have
specifically
ask
for
this
info
can
customer
expect
follow-up
email
think
would
better
provide
this
info
right
off
bat
either
email
via
link
hey
kaihj
will
rewrite
this
meant
let
you
know
below
will
improve
this
there
have
been
discussions
recently
about
how
much
role
creeping
towards
sales
post-sales
may
want
mention
jbjonesjr
think
just
changing
something
like
mostly
involved
pre-sales
would
suffice
for
now
though
maybe
add
jamie
clause
you
jamie
federal
you
may
carry
out
deals
your
own
from
time
time
trollface
not
super
picky
about
wording
would
just
mention
more
than
just
pre-sales
since
that
deviation
from
how
role
was
described
months
ago
because
their
first-hand
experience
field
s/on
field/in
field
could
helpful
add
brief
explanation
for
each
section
smile
this
should
really
more
emphatic
than
facilitate
something
like
schedule
regularly
hold
1:1s
with
team
members
this
seems
like
something
would
want
ics
doing
well
good
point
humanize
but
think
suggestion
assuming
1:1
even
happens
regularly
something
that
happens
informally
wonder
best
leave
person
managing
decide
cadence
not
sure
follow
your
suggestion
fatcomma
totally
agree
actually
want
ics
doing
everything
this
list
smile
think
key
here
manager
one
responsible
for
making
sure
gets
documented
this
should
really
more
emphatic
than
facilitate
guess
does
sound
kinda
strange
now
that
you
point
out
smirk
agreed
add
that
next
pass
with
davideg
kaihj
help
sparkling_heart
would
just
mention
more
than
just
pre-sales
because
their
first-hand
experience
field
what
about
inside
team
here
what
said
because
their
first-hand
experience
with
customer
grows
their
career
johnagan
think
should
also
specify
this
applies
both
inside
teams
here
grows
their
career
for
either
inside
solutions
solutions
might
make
sense
include
both
e.g
with
customers
field
since
inside
team
also
does
field
work
smile
davideg
brntbeer
lost
your
comment
after
update
reposting
grows
their

johnagan
think
should
also
specify
this

both
inside

here
grows
their

inside

davideg
may

more
than
just
corporate
also

johnagan

add

others
mapped
out

this

john
mentioned
other
teams
future
brntbeer
you
think
confusing
currently
written
think
would
more
appropriate
add
explanation
team/career/readme.md
explaining
that
these
documents
apply
all
teams
would
that
address
your
concern
davideg
yeah
both
mellybess
myself
came
same
conclusion
when
reading
this
that
conclusion
was
that
staff
meant
level
inside
team
was
that
progress
out
that
they
have
move
corporate
know
thats
not
case
now
because
discussed
with
john
lunch
other
day
think
would
more
appropriate
add
explanation
team/career/readme.md
explaining
that
these
documents
apply
all
teams
would
that
address
your
concern
would
happy
with
that
use
you
judgement
whether
not
also
add
here
just
get
worried
that
someone
would
stumble
this
miss
readme
confused
but
guess
that
kinda
their
fault
torn
gotcha
thanks
for
spelling
out
confusion
for
now
add
something

people
still
get

god
bless
anyone

but
you
right
torn
because
kind
think
that
article
friendly
for
all
developers
like
windows
just
points
them
downloading
from

instead
for
windows
which
comes
with
for
now
this
fine
thoughhh
recon
seems
like
sales
jargon
can
you
use
full
word
explain
its
meaning
somewhere
agree
that
recon
does
quite
sound
right
this
context
this
more
check-in
status
check
good
with
either
suggestion
azizshamim
were
using
term
recon
last
week
when
discussing
this
but
always
for
terms
that
less
salesy
webdog
that
miscommunication
part
allstate
moving

this
gives
opportunity
have
proactive

great

amore
open

how
have
you

yeah
definitely
latter
like
your
open-ended

format
intent
try
open

discuss
how
devs
across

collaborating
hopefully
re-using
code
when
they
can

push
conversations
with

idea
cross-team

why
re-write

has
solved

smiley_cat
heart
azizshamim
discussed
idea
outside
conducting
this
independent

certainly
open
suggestion
having
people
listen
once
hold

meeting
with

which
driving
this
s/their/there
s/their/there/g
remember
when
was
able

correctly
crying_cat_face
see_no_evil
think
this
got
put
new

accidentally
looks
little
wonky
this
necessary
when
rendered
markdown
headings
come
with
anchors
e.g
what-is-jenkinscloudbees
unfortunately
bold
while
inside
another
italics
block
supported
quoting
source
perhaps
quote
block
would
make
more
sense
quote
block
can
you
clarify
what
you
mean
like
toc
link
relevant
sections
but
know
how
create
links
they
coming
with
anchors
off
bat
you
look
latest
commit
toc
setup
headings
but
they
actually
link
sections
below
toc
instead
header
elements
would
just
turn
these
into
links
headers
below
remove
some
this
spacing
does
render
with
extra
space
these
event
names
events
would
want
this
trigger
push
delivery
server
know
what
this
trigger
execution
scripts
remote
server
from
post
messages
just
realized
that
none
other
descriptions
explicitly
say
web
app
that
xxx
post
nice
trigger
execution
scripts
remote
server
this
implementation
detail
that
might
explicit
for
this
doc
since
dependency
checks
can
done
multitude
ways
hate
prescribe
one
many
times
when
software
upticked
version
number
perhaps
additional
dependencies
might
introduced
software
modified
for
example
trading
application
that
communicates
with
external
market-data
provider
may
begin
using
newer
version
market
data
provider
api
this
sentence
could
more
generic
could
any
application
using
client
library
for
api
good
idea
using
api
library
example
continuous
integration
server
can
then
return
dependencies
present
status
according
status
api
docs
create-a-status
dependencies
present
not
valid
status
how
about
something
like
protected
branches
required
statuses
allow
for
more
dynamic
security
model
where
you
can
protect
unprotect
branches
depending
current
needs
project
this
contrast
fork
pull
model
where
you
set
appropriate
access
using
team
permissions
this
affects
core
workflow
your
developers
use
changing
security
model
more
disruptive
confused
what

why

why

cool
that
what
jbjonesjr
thought
well
but
wanted
confirm
ahhhh
yeah
totally
this
was
note
you
later
then
was
this
more
ask
for

before
change

what
worth

aws-sales-engineering.pem
make

change
while

make

you
fine
folks
for
when

ugh
thought
fixed
that

fixed

afaik
this

though
this

would
cool
mentioning

gpadak
these

still

going

probably
even
need
put

that

expand

good

can
you
describe

cheap

running

can
really
add
azizshamim
did
want
make

would
you

think
enough
describe

how
find

with

someone
elses

aws

that
azizshamim
maybe
can
include
that
something
for

pem

also
lastpass
shikhathakkar
very
well
put
essential

agreed
anyone
team
should
able
manage
any

our
aws

worth
adding
regional
information
this
poorly
ordered
can
reorder
them
before

absolutely
they
sort
grew
people
wrote
definitely
should
get
some
format
order
heart
before
ship
personally
like
spectacle
www.spectacleapp.com
for
this
stuck_out_tongue
very
straightforward
simple
that
should
with
also
wish
was
just
fire
skull
question
status
torn
here
think
boxen
still
great
tool
for
keeping
your
local
environment
date
but
without
maintainer
confused
mikemcquaid
should
recommending
new
hires
use
boxen
all
think
should
end
recommending
whatever
recommends
their
new
hires
use
perhaps
this
becomes
strap
another
for
spectacle
currently
would
say
boxen
strap
until
strap
more
widely
supported
people
only
using
e.g
then
strap
fine
for
now
fiiiiine

this

for

ses
but
inside

work

really
inside

work

think
you
inside
you
still
want

your

but
probably
does
matter
change
this

set
your

either

depending
which

since

you
can

but
that

sounds
generic
you

really
like
this
goal
this
may
confuse
new
starters
slightly
where
define
what
technical
sales
person
means
why
put
quote
marks
should
say
sales
engineer
instead
shadowing
incredibly
useful
but
need
mindful
that
shadowing
opportunities
may
times
difficult
come
especially
grow
when
first
started
often
found
that
someone
had
already
asked
included
call
want
many
hubbers
call
for
prospect
feel
crowded
factors
that
may
make
this
difficult
include
different
geos
timezones
different
languages
e.g
japanese
multiple
simultaneous
hires
who
all
want
shadow
possible
solutions
put
onus
sdr
buddy
with
one
more
new
hires
invite
them
calls
rather
than
having
seek
out
opportunities
add
alternative
activities
cover
shadowing
dry
periods
e.g
videos
think
should
add
watch
few
vanilla
demos
our
vimeo
account
then
shadow
another
giving
live
demo
that
new
person
has
understanding
what
typical
demo
looks
like
but
can
see
how
things
adjusted
fly
during
real
call
also
think
this
should
come
before
shadow/watch
demo
smile
agree
with
kaihj
unfortunately
know
how
feasible
this
yet
sob
talking
about
practice
recording
like
suggested
onboarding
guide
live
one
with
customer
this
assigned
week
yet
still
unassigned
section
towards
tail
end
month
ramp
this
assigned
week
yet
but
meant
giving
one
live
customer
yep
that
sounds
like
good
fix
kaihj
shikhathakkar
think
this
was
just
from
notes
had
with
davideg
yeah
totally
could
decide
how
heavy
this
week
was
yet
thought
scale
back
single
inbox
like
idea
halp
duty
because
there
inbox
with
question
you
dont
know
how
answer
you
can
just
follow
halp-guide
how
handle
those
meant
specifically
configure
ldap
have
instance
anymore
haha
ahh
yeah
this
would
become
more
set
configure
ldap
for
your
instance
for
instance
today
fermentedbeats
sat
down
set
travisci
that
what
was
thinking
totally
items
week-by-week
break
down
definitely
not
ordered
especially
with
kaihj
point
available
opportunities
you
watch
demo
given
week
just
carries
over
next
would
add
that
here
but
this
ramp-up-plan
meant
come
after
their
onboarding
checklist
onboarding
checklist
doc
mention
watch
demos
week
beyond
but
that
later
trimmed
maybe
just
say
week
demos
want
many
hubbers
call
for
prospect
feel
crowded
think
this
super
important
something
didnt
consider
when
was
first
coming
board
thought
with
this
whole
checklist
that
customizable
per
new
that
none
set
stone
there
week
where
there
lot
calls
maybe
skip
ahead
next
week
work
some
those
activities
really
like
idea
pairing
with
sdrs/csrs
for
some
these
ensure
they
get
invited
calls
this
should
work
all
time
zones
well
interested
hear
some
ideas
around
how
pair
new
ses
automatically
that
something
manager
buddies
decide
when
they
going
through
this
doc
customize
want
many
hubbers
call
for
prospect
feel
crowded
typically
person
shadowing
introduced
see
issue
with
multiple
people
shadowing
unless
in-person
put
onus
sdr
buddy
with
one
more
new
hires
invite
them
calls
rather
than
having
seek
out
opportunities
experience
opposite
more
effective
easy
for
reps
forget
include
extra
people
calls
when
they
busy
ses
should
feel
comfortable
being
proactive
about
finding
calls
shadow
someone
having
tough
time
their
buddy
should
able
help
them
edit
only
seen
how
this
works
maybe
different
process
makes
more
sense
for
remote
ses
maybe
just
watch
recorded
demo
with
link
q=is
3aissue+label
3ademo+is

fatcomma
good
points
think
your
last
sentence
hits
nail
head
not
black
white
pointing
them
their
buddy
they
need
assistance
probably
way
typically
person
shadowing
introduced
would
customer
see
them
list
participants
bluejeans
agree
with
fatcomma
point
his
above
comment
r38812795
since
this
phone
call
should
obvious
customer
that
there
other
hubbers
shadowing
same
can
not
said
for
jeans
move
your
suggestion
about
ensuring
call
does
have
many
hubbers
line
below
shadow
csr
csm
call
dont
want
overwhelm
customer
also
just
noticed
double
stuck_out_tongue
think
this
should
must
some
point
rather
than
alternative
watching
someone
else
demo
mentioned
onboarding
checklist
demos
also
because
markdown
alternative
gets
hidden
rendered
version
markdown
interprets
bullet
alternative
link
this
not
thing
anymore
diff-f15afee15e0849c7efc70df0552a5ea4r224
you
can
check
out
sdr
playbook
sdrs
should
include
ses
calls
except
special
circumstances
instead
should
defer
technical
questions
csr
esr
who
will
schedule
time
for
follow-up
call
would
customer
see
them
list
participants
bluejeans
blue
jeans
session
then
extra
participants
would
visible
anyone
who
meeting
their
browser
kaihj
sales
reps
using
video
function
jeans
just
audio
just
audio
then
sales
reps
could
make
point
giving
dial-in
numbers
only
not
sending
over
link
join
via
browser
this
way
anyone
else
could
join
without
making
big
deal
alternatively
could
find
out
how
jeans
stream
for
works
perhaps
always
have
sales
user
joined
call
which
could
use
broadcast
meetings
anyone
who
wanted
shadow
not
sure
customers
would
ask
questions
about
this
user
would
non-issue
just
some
thoughts
great
catch
double
only
reason
worded
this
way
was
because
watching
recorded
demo
apart
checklist
itself
this
ramp
plan
demos
going
through
that
checklist
later
remove
items
like
this
one
move
here
though
fixed
also
because
markdown
alternative
gets
hidden
rendered
version
markdown
interprets
bullet
alternative
link
thanks
fixed
made
these
must
for
this
week
happy
change
next
week
something
oauth
with
capital
smile
e.g
ldap
asks
server
user
allowed
access
something
like
repo
would
start
saying
that
ldap
can
used
give
users
generic
access
then
would
add
what
you
typed
e.g
that
ldap
can
also
used
map
teams
organization
units
saying
this
because
former
main
use
case
opinion
allowed
access
something
like
repo
would
more
precise
language
potentially
use
copy
creating
teams
with
ldap
sync
enabled
creating
teams
with
ldap
sync
enabled
small
note
but
would
lower-case
fyi
here
when
you
say
switches
ldap
you
mean
switches
from
basic
authentication
believe
these
considered
web
protocols
since
web
refers
world
wide
web
en.wikipedia.org/wiki/world_wide_web
when
think
web
protocol
think
you
can
probably
call

this

this

til
smile_cat
have
heard
about
this
what
does
mean
overwrite
pre-existing

you
talking
about
overwriting
ssh
keys
for
preexisting
users
users
themselves
that
awesome
question
think
probably
called
them
protocols
during
talk
tongue
ldap
definitely
protocol
light-weight
directory
access
protocol
well
domain
model/format
saml
markup
language
that
transported
over
protocol
just
like
html
markup
language
just
domain
model/format
oauth
token/authentication
architecture
that
when
needing
transmit/exchange
data
will
things
over
sort
bit
everything
full
client/server
domain/storage
model
cas
application
with
defined
api
data
model
that
supports
authentication
over
what
does
this
mean
they
really
completely
different
technologies
may
best
say
that
ldap
saml
oauth
sso
authentication
technologies
support
authentication
using
oauth
deprecated
probably
should
part
communications
with
new
customers
set
2.3
will
removed
completely
3.0
also
important
distinguish
between
user
authentication
using
oauth
allowing
application
authentication
using
oauth
which
going
away
see
for
some
more
background
currently
stalled
disappointed
customer
communication
plan
also
agree
with
jbjonesjr
discussion_r38489363
how
describe
authentication
methods
these
great
descriptions
can
get
best
reference/source
links
well
especially
interested
your
recommendations
for

cas
saml
would
change
this

suggestion
that
jbjonesjr
makes

really
like
his

each

well
should
figure

what

could
act

also
great
guide
had
seen
this
100
unless
pointing
client
docs
from
specific
product
version
usually
remove
version
number
always
get

most
recent
one
would
add
shortnames
after

service
provider
next
paragraph
introduce
but
properly
introduce
before
something
like
identity
provider
idp
service
provider
implementation
saml
initially
thought
was
reference
footer
document
this
version
number
would
either
use
saml

would
cap
product

active

openldap
oracle

missing
opening
extra

before
ldap-sync
s/synched/synced
would
personally
would
cap
username

fermentedbeats
perhaps
italics
bold
italics
for
example
questions
this
better
way
set
these
apart
help
them
stand
apart
from

fermentedbeats
list
bit
disjointed
perhaps
complete
listing
saml
v.2
standard
can
found
here
fermentedbeats
more
grammar
nerd
eyeglasses
stuff
maybe
loaded
term
that
can
interchangeably
refer
fermentedbeats
this
bit
unclear
could
wrongly
influence
people
not
familiar
with
auth
2fa
since
2fa
implemented
identity
provider
level
idp
implement
with
idp
native
auth
can
provide
2fa
strongly-recommended
option
customer
using
saml
saml
provider
implement
e.g
okta
2fa
should
just
careful
saying
auth
since
there
still
customers
out
there
who
using
oauth
often
shortened
explained
auth
also
written
built
authentication
should
just
careful
saying
auth
agreed
these
still
todo
items
jbjonesjr
would
you
want
ship
this
with
these
there
you
may
want
remove
most
comments
above
this
line
just
add
general
since
more
conversational
also
self
deprecating
this
was
good
work
100
definitely
agree
with
brntbeer
here
smile_cat
this
originally
confused
because
end
user
there
only
two
pieces
information
repository
name
repository
owner
could
personal
account
organization
what
organization
they
belong
would
call
out
that
this
internal
distinction
not
user-facing
perhaps
even
spell
out
directly
that
internal
attribute
for
repository
called
organization
like
you
get
later
this
document
there
ever
situation
where
two
repositories
have
same
name
owner
but
different
organization
attribute
seems
that
name
owner
alone
adequate
for
uniqueness
just
created
repository
organization
with
name
test
then
tried
fork
repository
called
test
from
personal
account
renamed
forked
repository
test-1
which
seems
confirm
statement
above
well
those
where
repository
that
name
already
exists
this
was
case
testing
ghe
2.3
was
able
fork
repository
with
same
name
but
was
created
old-name-1
instead
old-name
getting
bit
confused
word
ownership
this
document
think
you
talking
about
who
allowed
control
access
fork
think
would
helpful
explicit
when
explaining
this
what
does
accurately
display
fork
mean
you

think
this
can
written

more
clearly

clearer
state
existing
behavior
first
then
perhaps
mention
false
expectations
stuck_out_tongue
instead
by-product
organization
membership
usual
not
property
fork
process
think
understand
what
you
trying

but
confused
this
sentence
what
does
organization
membership
mean
you
talking
about
value
set
for
organization
attribute
think
will
helpful
try
explicit
nope
first
answer
yes
own
then
fork
into
org
you
have
admin
second
one
has
any
clue
kind
sure
there
code
somewhere
but
all
reality
find
waiting
until
after
direct
orgs
answer
this
also
self
deprecating
that
our
thing
www.debretts.com/british-etiquette/british-behaviour/r-s/self-deprecation
agree
that
this
great
work
this
line
was
source
todo
top
doc
actually
bit
more
complex
than
this
each
user
terms
org
person
can
only
have
copy
repo
lineage
lineage
mean
only
single
repo
that
related
ancestory
another
repo
may
included
since
your
example
two
test
repos
not
share
ancestor
related
you
could
have
them
both
just
adjusted
name
necessary
general
with
further
review
this
line
can
clarified
language
for
forking
repository
where
you
already
own
relative
repository
this
what
you
were
doing
just
two
similarly
named
repos
ownership
this
situation
abstract
term
you
correct
intended
talk
about
who
can
make
administrative
decisions
about
fork
yes
current
permissions
system
before
direct

only
members
owners
team
members
admin

can
create

creates

then
new

added
that
admin
team
well
owners
team
all
organization-owned
repositories
get
added
owners
team
true
but
what
you
two
admin
teams
seems
picks
one
with
min_date
join_date
but
that
date
logic
not
exposed
anywhere
similarly
member
owners
team
creates
repository
new
repository
only
added
owners
team
regardless
what
other
teams
member
only
thought
here
was
since
user
see
that
value
was
trying
quantify
this
some
way
using
notion
membership
because
back
original
problem
just
looking
owner/repo
name
does
tell
you
enough
info
who
has
administrative
control
can
you
clarify
what
internal
not
user-facing
means
s/families/families
might
worth
mentioning
that
referred
network
just
stafftools
help
docs
just
tested
when
you
delete
parent
warns
you
that
will
delete
fork
because
private
this
means
that
user
not
actually
able
see
this
piece
information
can
more
clear
with
this
statement
wish
had
better
way
describe
this
sachinr
which
scenario
did
you
fork
delete
from
this
when
you
forked
from
orga
into
orgb
you
deleted
orga
said
would
delete
orgb
did
you
test
octodemo
this
difference
between
forks
private
public
repo
contains
details
how
this
all
works
below
all
private
repositories
hope
this
clears

does

just
remove

shikhathakkar
happy
with
your
caveat
believe
azizshamim
intends
open
issue
about
this
added
some
language
this
let
know
looks
okay
per
conversation
with
azizshamim

think
should
remove

completely
still
valuable
resource
davideg
that
language
keeping

things
like
use
your

judgement
give
willies
because
inviting
someone
wrong

just
drive
comment

jbjonesjr
this

less
risky
then
trust
put
every

perform
during
on-site

not
worried
about
this

this

will
obviously
edited
forward
but
idea
all

under

point
points
for
person
work
estimated

period
whether
not
things
get

bit
does
all

below
fall
under

sure
does
let
add

another
catch
all

below
keep
this
should
have
waited
comment
after

was
thinking
just
things
between
here
miscellaneous
section
week
that
much
seemed
like
one
big
win
for

was
posting
least
draft
reply
you
have
least
one
item
you
can
point
back
say
done
that
maybe
week
long
that
but
just
imagine
actually
completing
everything
checklist

where
week
general
boarding

your

brntbeer
agree

that
reasonable

get

start
looking

might

yeah
why
not
fatcomma
what
your
thoughts
with
this
last

here
love
getting
back
people
even
let
them

looking
into
feeling
ignored
something
that
should
happen
thoughts
this
trying
find
out
where
mention
you
can
not
find

bring
some
additional
eyes
sales-engineering
look
fatcomma
can
you
help
here
thinking
maybe
right
after
this
number
possibly
substitute
this
number
decided
remove
this
section
because
implied
that
this
correct
outlining
our
workflow
throughout
this
document
happy
add
back
needs
really
driven
home
our
answer
think
there
needs
another
line
break
under
here
first
point
shows
same
line
example
would
add
that
after
last
bullet
point
reason
for
question
feels
like
should
also
have
step
for
searching
halp
smile
some
minor
rephrasing
suggestions
sales-engineering
label
each
our
sales
inboxes
one
that
every
should
watching
every
should
watch
sales-engineering
label
each
our

order
notified
label
being
added
you
have
watch
inbox
that
you
wish
watch
notified
whenever
this
label
added
halp
thread
you
have
watch
each
inbox
where
you
like
receive
notifications
not
quite
true
that
you
have
have
saved
search
you
could
perform
label
sales-engineering
search
each
time
that
said
course
highly
recommend
doing
this
obviously
see
mentions
here
there
but
tool
compiles
those
for
nice
neat
view
well
halp
does
compile
those
mentions
list
but
real
problem
that
you
have
idea
knowing
whether
those
mentions
still
relevant
here
suggested
rephrasing
get
attention
timely
manner
sales
team
will
add
sales-engineering
label
threads
easy
see
all
threads
needing
attention
searching
for
that
label
without
scoping
search
particular
inbox
because
labels
can
removed
from
threads
this
search
makes
easy
see
only
threads
that
still
need
attention
mentions
helpful
for
bumping
threads
but
there
nice
way
know
thread
where
mention
appeared
still
requires
attention
unless
labels
also
used
see
list
all
threads
all
inboxes
that
have
label
sales-engineering
highly
recommend
creating
saved
search
work
through
responses
answer
questions
that
people
need
answer
hmm
this
confuses
how
about
rephrasing
this
line
view
all
threads
needing
attention
using
sales-engineering
label
saved
search
take
appropriate
action
adding
responses
where
they
needed
more
checking
thread
still
needs
attention
rather
than
rep
wanting
removed
also
what
does
mean
ping
thread
would
explicit
here
avoid
ambiguity
thread
has
been
open
for
while
after
mentioning
sale
rep
feel
free
remove
sales-engineering
label
comment
that
you
doing
personally
prefer
mention
place
ping
but
not
big
deal
others
maybe
have
this
part
their
daily
routine
others
may
search
for

adding

let

including

having

believe
most

just
talk

bump

this

mention
two

that

would

remove

saying
something

would
add

even

feels

with

along

completely

possibly

you

that

yes
pass

really
good
point
other
day
about
using
push
logs
comparing
ssh
keys
long
way
answer
this
question
with
2.4
coming
few
days
should
include
something
about
protected
branches
here
with
2.4
coming
out
need
change
this
wording
quite
production
ready
also
wonder
should
include
mention
protected
branches
this
portion
also
like
ask
this
concern
something
that
actually
happened
s/git-lfs/git
lfs
like
asking
repository
size
due
files
being
stored
size
history
can
useful
determine
whether
lfs
makes
sense
good
question
not
sure
about
this
since
lfs
still
has
been
heavily
tested
explore
should
that
exploit
pholleran
wave
using
required
status
verify
that
pusher
either
committer
author
this
line
you
referring
required
status
implies
protected
branches
would
you
want
make
that
explicit
were
you
thinking
about
new
talking
point
pholleran

add
something
like
starting
with
2.4
pholleran

kaihj
exploit
much
better
for
this
bitoiu
that

updating
now
understand
idea
having
read-only
mirror
set
but
not
sure
how
dns

fits
here
understand
what
means
important
implement
something
important
right
word
here
davideg
this
could
have
been
better
explained
dns
fallback
most
likely
not
best
term
during
upgrade
situation
server
not
available
clients
could
redirect
mirror
this
would
for
read
only
purposes
else
would
get
trickier
trickier
you
think
this
option
all
davideg
while
trying
explain
what
meant
think
just
better
change
sentence
variation
works
machine
named
makes
sense
head
disappointed
from
technical
point
view
this
does
seem
big
challenge
compared
lot
what
client
might
wonder
why
would
would
jeopardise
business
opportunity
for
what
apparently
simple
request
client
does
understand
our
devotion
for
importance
concise
between
com
ghe
might
pass
arrogant
does
that
make
sense
you
suggesting
they
set
read-only
mirror
that
uses
same
url
scheme
that
local
pulls/clones
just
work™
how
about
that
seen
folks
that
stubborn
arrogant
implement
such
simple
change
davideg
yes
redirection/mirroring
had
seamless
for
clients
though
davideg
thanks
smile
how
about
request
zero
downtime
comes
from
need
having
data
available
read
they
could
consider
setting
mirror
server
for
use
during
upgrade
possibly
set
mirror
use
same
url
scheme
that
local
pulls
clones
just
work™

missing

knows
nothing
something

you
need
install

your
computer
commonly

that
designed

smart

few

have
reading

how

does

use
cac

windows
does
that
mean
have

what
some
common

middleware

link
get
what
you
getting
but
suspect
most
readers
care
flip
order

you

you
not

you

this

there
preference

again
think

could
help
you

you
put

you
probably

readers
what
about
mac/linux
this
uses
for
windows
one
its
underlying

all
need
download
ghfw
why
did
just
read
all
that
for
each
these
tell
what
need
front
get
darn
thing
work
then
into
more
detail
interested
facto
with
italics
this
really
suggested
required
call
this

known

which
bit
more
professional
helpful

was
definitely
after
thought
included
alot
internal/todo

well
w/r/t
linking
cac

this
document
has
taken
many
different
lives
throughout
construction
but
currently
trying
govt
technology
agnostic
more
about
using
smart
cards
for
that
purpose
that
why
put
that
sort
detail
appendix
section
this
document
place
holder
for
actually
getting
cas
work
for
configuration
right
now
have
had
time
implement
this
main
todo
still
left
benbalter
agree
with
everything
you
said
comments
for
this
doc
but
after
thinking
trying
type
really
come
with
anything
want
take
crack
this
specific
doc
was
added
sort
entry
way
into
other
doc
try
put
support
implementation
into
bigger
context
think
specifics
other
high
level
details
out
scope
for
this
doc
instead
should
just
reference
out
help
docs
where
applicable
you
right
overarching
narrative
missing
from
doc/guide
which
mostly
list
technical
right
now
think
some
that
can
come
from
this
being
built
into
better
heirarchy
flow
between
sections
your
middleware
questions
good
some
answered
later
doc
some
answered
all
gfe
different
know
what
you
have
how
identify
thought
some
this
was
move
these
sections
which
were
duplicated
below
into
common
placement
top
this
changed
flow/readability
negative
way
but
improved
maintainability
accuracy
goal
would
use
something
like
ssh
docs
use
that
have
sort
tabbed-os
switcher
middleware
not
required
know
proposed
this
question
but
think
probably
need
reworded
that
customers
understand
maybe
what
storage
system
you
planning
use
directly
attached
disks
ssds
rotating
nas
nas
you
have
details
about
underlying
disks
raid
configuration
provisioned
bandwidth
operations
per
second
totally
open
further
refinements
there
nitpick
but
instance
should
capitalised
also
thinking
just
being
able
copy
paste
this
user
may
want
say
instance
since
have
lot
types
infrastructure
that
support
what
changed
this
what
current
infrastructure
place
this
also
gives
flexibility
continue
expand
our
infrastructure
offerings
small
misspellings
here
also
was
bit
more
verbose
with
this
sentence
there
ramp
schedule
e.g
you
looking
organically
growing
instance
only
bringing
specific
business
units
certain
times
again
this
copy
pasted
would
want
spell
out
ghe
also
server
fleet
term
not
familiar
with
wonder
how
many
machines
virtual
physical
you
deploy
mcolyer
this
usually
hard
question
for
customer
answer
have
also
tried
get
them
share
with
iops
they
getting
from
storage
subsystem
they
usually
have
multiple
tiers
storage
ask
what
recommend
this
normally
not
just
fastest
you
can
get
but
gets
into
what
type
redundancy
they
leverage
raid
raid
when
using
ssds
have
heard
they
should
using
raid
which
can
become
cost
prohibitive
but
would
give
them
best
throughput
disk
level
but
then
connection
network
slow
this
really
does
matter
currently
doing
benchmarking
with
found
out
storage
subsystem
openstack
slower
than
vmware
yep
understanding
performance
characteristics
their
storage
one
more
challenging
aspects
evaluating
their
infrastructure
but
also
one
most
important
would
push
get
much
information
possible
that
will
vary
from
customer
customer
customers
willing
benchmark
you
mentioned
that
ideal
scenario
there
many
factors
play
that
only
way
really
know
what
performance
expect
server
fleet
was
copy
paste
what
trying
ask
how
many
servers
will
you
deploying
simultaneously
think
fes
what
storage
system
you
planning
use
directly
attached
disks
ssds
rotating
nas
nas
you
have
details
about
underlying
disks
raid
configuration
provisioned
bandwidth
operations
per
second
maybe
can
just
ask
them
what
protocol
they
using
nfs
cifs
iscsi
none
etc
can
then
deduce
whether
they
using
san
nas
direct
attached
that
point
also
worth
asking
they
have
storage
architecture
diagram
health
reports
something
along
those
lines
they
using
grade
san
nas
device
they
willing
share
used
make
those
for
customers
quarterly
basis
emc
but
can
get
numbers
type
disk
raid
config
read/write
percentage
pretty
easy
figure
out
rough

number
maybe
can
just
ask

they
using

these

know
that
bottom
this

how
often

this

this

will
called
protected

part
feature
people
can
require

protecting

also

force

deleting

bleikamp
that
really
huge
did
realize
this
was
just

overall

definitely
get

only

brntbeer
for

explicit

that

once

out

kind
eventually

technically
you

major

rarely
have

sat
this

for

but
after
further

want
start

this

will
inevitably
get

not

day
out
development
life
worry
that
over-simplication
wrong
impression
cast

negative

could
considered
friction
under
this

but
their
benefit
has
been
proven
there
many
reasons
restrict
protect
developers
from
committing
improper
data
ssh
keys
etc
which
inherently
negative
thoughts
intent
guide
this
case
bit
forboding
that
recommend
introduction
feature
that
could
very
easily
have
negative
return
software
developer
experience
while
benefit
code
review
clear
its
ability
add

pre-rx
hooks
has
ability
stop
code
from
being
committed
all
prior
any
human
review
while
there
clearly
beneficial
reasons
that
there
far
more
potentially
harmful
uses
want
create
appropriate
level
respect
awareness
for
what
this
feature
capable
doing
for
better
for
worse
then
perhaps
edit
such
while
this

could
viewed
one
that
increases
used
increase
friction
for
developer
that
clarifies
that

process
inherently

just
that
can

way
then
use

already

that

let
also
assume
that
prospect
has

around
their

that
they
have
approached
because
support
performance

your
statement

still
apply
but
would
relevant
progression

value
for
comes
from
how
helps
prospect
solve
key
problems
whatever
they
may
using

effectively
will
always
tick
many
boxes
but
there
other

just
wondering

can
swivel
little
more
towards

away
from

rename

over

maybe
happy

that
being
pedantic
use
customers
line
then
accounts

might
add
clarity
use

same
think
this
fair
point
sticking
just
talking
about
using
product
effectively
same
getting
value
from
our
offering
other
ways
that
customers
get
value
from
e.g
better
support
experience
better
deployment
configuration
experience
etc
that

trying

outside

recognize
that

large

how

customers
derive

fundamentally
value
comes
from
how

can
just
help

just
best
for

ping

sounds

something
around

2-4
where
on-boarding
consists
scheduling

1:1
with
various
people
other
than
your

you

also
sat

this
great

johnagan
maybe
people
from

esr
ops
teams
get
cross-functional
sales
introductions
with
csrs/csms
that
cover
your

you

also
you

you
can

please
check
that
you
happy
with

this
key
technical

product
obviously
important
but
placing

customer
finding

help

their
pain
points
key
winning
customer
what
does
type
mean
here
you
asking
what
tool
they
use
e.g
jenkins
travis
etc
something
else
this
learn
about
their
development
processes
not
much
concerned
about
what
tool
they
using
just
they
plan
use
polling
webhooks
does
that
help
leefaus
does
this
work
for
you
trying
make
this
more
clear
that
will
work
thanks
davideg
this
would
require
user
utilize
private/public
keypair
with
protocol
leverage
personal
authentication
token
for
completing
their
commits
protocol
for
read-only
access
over
git-scm.com/book/en/v2/git-on-the-server-the-protocols
the-http-protocols
right
think
you
thinking
using
private/public
keypair
with
ssh
unless
mistaken
actually
its
own
protocol
that
defaults
port
9418
thanks
for
clarifying
that
matthewmccullough
you
use
keypairs
with
protocol
davideg
good
question
protocol
provides
protection
encryption
data
over
air
un/pw
verification
used
only
rarest
cases
these
days
have
seen
used
field
long
time
used
most
efficient
for
transfers
but
recall
peff
iirc
saying
that
delta
had
become
small
was
worth
even
talking
about
e.g
single
digit
percent
delta
two
three
good
resources
include
protocols-to-choose-from-when-cloning
git-scm.com/book/en/v2/git-on-the-server-git-daemon
this
how
used
serve
repos
students
limited-internet
situations
git-scm.com/book/en/v2/git-internals-transfer-protocols
indeed
going
forward
only
games
town
really
ssh
what
end
though
think
there
enough
information
out
there
fully
empower
asker
with
response
reading
rationale
for
this
question
super-must
candidate
does
know
our
sales
strategy
directing
people
com
for
any
particular
reason
they
happen
answer
with
bias
they
should
explain
why
they
did
people
may
not
know
markdown
going
but
they
ship
revision
that
has
obvious
markdown-related
issues
then
have
problem
flat
text
without
markdown
enhancement
shoul
viewed
negatively
though
think
implication
here
that
not
just
jira
but
any
mention
other
tools/integrations
that
can
used
should
come
with
concrete
examples
links
integration
information
actually
think
acknowledging
capturing
feedback
expectation
still
believe
this
actually
happens
what
think
someone
saying
that
you
more
than
welcome
try
porting
over
yourself
but
blah
blah
blah
support
since
others
have
done
going
add
note
say
that
very
few
gist
perfect
that
good
bad
need
weighed
pragmatic
manner
yeah
that
does
properly
capture
intention
what
would
like
see
nice
have
that
once
answered
their
immediate
technical
question
move
towards
getting
meeting
either
phone
call
demo
some
sort
will
update
guide
not
particularly
big
recommending
customers
something
that
would
leave
them
unsupported
position
would
include
this
guide
but
comes
would
expect
rationale
explain
why
they
took
that
approach
this
model
talk
about
for
open
source
projects
that
longer
requires
need
submit
patches
bugzilla
for
code
contributions
not
sure
what
bugzilla
doing
there
stuck_out_tongue
once
user
has
modified
code
through
series
commits
they
will
push
those
changes
their
master
branch
when
user
feels
like
code
ready
merged
into
upstream
project
they
will
open
pull
request
against
original
repositories
branch
encourages
workflow
where
you
create
pull
request
comparing
branch
your
personal
fork
master
upstream
repository
think
common
first
push
your
personal
fork
master
branch
before
opening
pull
request
correct
wrong
here
would
add
that
gives
control
project
maintainers
over
what
code
ends
getting
merged
into
project
without
limiting
outside
contributors
ability
contribute
changes
hmm
this
true
why
should
contributors
with
read-write
access
work
out
personal
fork
instead
just
using
new
branch
opening
pull
request
very
little
oversight
given
code
this
team
produces
this
certainly
can
true
but
our
best
practices
have
you
always
using
pull
requests
suggest
changes
that
there
lots
visibility
eyes
code
team
produces
maybe
not
oversight
exactly
but
feel
this
statement
does
capture
how
trusted
developer
model
does
encourage
lots
attention
code
changes
edit
whoops
see
you
differentiating
between
something
called
trusted
developer
model
flow
model
think
this
naming
confused
because
trusted
developer
model
experience
refers
this
setup
but
using
flow
this
model
good
for
companies
that
have
developed
internal
frameworks
that
need
share
them
with
consultants
that
going
including
these
frameworks
inside
their
applications

what
does
managing
team
refer
here
not
sure
why
you
would
want
set
situation
like
this
you
still
like
unit
regression
tests
run
changes
that
untrusted
consultants
making
right
not
doing
agree
with
same
comment
about
above
thinking
about
adding
tests
